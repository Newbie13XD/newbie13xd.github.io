"... where am I?" You attempt to open your eyes, only to realise how heavy they feel.
<br><br>"What happened?", you ask yourself as you being seeing things, realising that you're lying on the ground
in a forest. The forest is dark, lush, green, and you see someone lying down in the distance. A distance not too far
away, and you decide to start crawling in that direction through the surprisingly trim grass.
Before you get there, however, you think to yourself "What if the person lying there is dangerous?
What if he's the reason I'm here in this weird location in the first place?"<br><br>

As you look back to where you first woke up, you see the person you earlier saw. He's still helplessly
lying on the ground, not moving a limb.<br><br>

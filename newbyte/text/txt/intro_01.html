You look around, watching the great lush trees move in the wind. Something is off about them, but you
can't quite put a finger on what it is. As you try to stand up, you realise your legs won't bear you. 
Unable to quite make out why, you look for somewhere to crawl to, realising how omnious and dark the 
surrounding woods appear, almost as though the vegetation forms a solid wall that blocks any passage.
On a second thought, should you maybe give whoever that person is a chance?<br><br>
